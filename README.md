# README

Hi! You are probably rating my code skills if you are reading this file!

So this is a test from an intership application that i've applied, and in this read.me i'll
document every thing that it's required from the test github.

First, make sure that you have ruby installed in your machine, because we're going to
use ruby on rails.

## Getting started 🏳️

  First, clone this repo to your machine usign 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Leonardo-Mazzuca/ummani-blog


  after you must use 
  
     ```bash
     bundle install


  And then you'll have to create the database, so 
  you have to run a couple commands.

  First, you should create the database 
  
    ```bash
    rails db:create
  
  
  Once this is done, you'll have to execute all migrations:

    ```bash
    rails db:migrate
   

  And finally to populate the database with default data, you'll
  populate the database using:

    ```bash
    rails db:seed


## Running the app 🏃‍♂️

  After all the last steps are done, you'll be able to run the app

     ```bash
     rails s

  And then try to access the app running at http://localhost:3000 !
